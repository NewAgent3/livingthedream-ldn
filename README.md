# pokeldn

A Linux computer speaking Nintendo Switch local wireless (LDN) to Pokémon games on a real Switch or
Switch 2. It hosts or joins the game's own wireless session and runs the game's protocol against a
retail console, with nothing installed on the console. Five games so far, plus a Tomodachi Life
module in bring-up:

| | FRLG | LGPE | SwSh | BDSP | PLA |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Trade | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mystery Gift | ✓ | ∅ | ✓ | ∅ | ∅ |
| Link battle | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ∅ |
| Code on the console, save read and write | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

✓ works on a retail console · ✗ not done · ∅ the game has no such feature over local wireless
FRLG FireRed/LeafGreen · LGPE Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee · SwSh Sword/Shield · BDSP Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl · PLA Legends Arceus

Everything runs on the same radio and the same LDN and Pia layers. FireRed and LeafGreen ship as
the original GBA ROM inside an emulator, so their GBA link protocol rides on top of those layers
where the three other games put their own code directly on Pia; nothing else about them is
different.

The full protocol documentation is at [decryptu.github.io/pokeldn](https://decryptu.github.io/pokeldn/).

The package is layered by what a module is true of: `pokeldn.ldn` is the wireless layer every Switch
title shares, `pokeldn.gba` is the GBA wireless adapter's protocol above it, and `pokeldn.frlg`,
`pokeldn.lgpe`, `pokeldn.swsh`, `pokeldn.bdsp` and `pokeldn.pla` are the games. Entry points are named for the game
they drive.

## Why?

This project basically exists to prove that it can be done. From here, I'm hoping the community takes notice so that we can get things like an unofficial GTS and online battling going. It should serve as a pretty good reference for anyone interested in pursuing these goals or anything else related to multiplayer within these games. AI tools were used to reverse engineer the protocol and to write parts of the code. If you'd like to contribute to the effort, join the [Discord!](https://discord.gg/PyvaVYnpXC)

## Demonstration
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0df878e-67f0-483d-ae81-583cfc2a8692

This demo was recorded using the **ALFA AWUS036ACHM**. The RZ616 is half as fast on average and sometimes deadlocks before gracefully exiting.

## Features

FireRed / LeafGreen

- Trading with a real game in both directions, with `.pk3` / `.ek3` input and output
- Mystery Gift in both directions: Wonder Cards with scripted deliveryman gifts, Wonder News, and a
  visiting Battle Tower trainer
- Union Room: greetings, trading-board trades, live chat, and full link battles
- Native code on the console through the gift link: reading and writing its save, mapping its ROM,
  calling its own functions, and building a Pokémon with its own `CreateMon`

Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee

- Trading in both directions; a box structure built here goes into the console's save as sent

Sword / Shield

- Trading a PKHeX `.pk8` into the console's game
- Mystery Gift: Wonder Cards built from the command line or served from a published `.wc8`
  (Pokémon, eggs, items, Battle Points, clothing)

Brilliant Diamond / Shining Pearl

- A character of pokeldn's own in the Union Room: walking, greeting, and trading through the game's
  own flow
- Record mixing, ball capsules and the battle lobby, up to the console sending its own records

Legends Arceus

- Trading into the console's save, hosting the session the console joins
- Any Pokémon the game has, composed from nothing: species, level, nature, ability, moves and their
  PP, mastered moves, alpha, shininess, nickname, individual and growth values, size, ball and met
  data, all from the game's own tables, and the stats the game itself would compute

Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream (bring-up: no session captured yet)

- A `.ltd` / `.ltd*` Mii and Palette House item library byte-compatible with ShareMii, filled from
  the game's own local-wireless exchange on a retail console - the game has no online play and no
  QR codes, so the exchange is the only way a Mii leaves an island
- Collector-to-collector transfer of `.ltd` files between two machines on the session, no console
  involved (the TOMO wire protocol: fragmentation, CRCs, acks, retransmission)
- A scanning tool that reads the game's sessions off the air; the first capture fixes the game's
  local communication id and Pia game key, the two constants the link still waits on

Every game

- An offline toolkit for reading a retail title's own code (`tools/switch/`)

## Requirements

- Linux
- Python 3.11+, and a venv with `requirements.txt` installed
- A compatible Wi-Fi card (see below)
- A Switch or Switch 2 with one of the games above. FireRed / LeafGreen needs the Direct Corner
  unlocked (about 20 to 40 minutes of play) and at least two `.pk3` files as party members
- Switch `prod.keys` (default location `~/.switch/prod.keys`)

The LDN implementation in [`vendor/LDN`](vendor/LDN) is installed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
The PyPI `ldn` package of the same version lacks the adapter compatibility fixes; do not substitute it.

### Wi-Fi cards

| model | type | driver | reliability |
|---|---|---|---|
| TP-Link Archer T3U (`2357:012d`) | external | `rtw88_8822bu` | high |
| ALFA AWUS036ACHM | external | `mt76x0u` | high |
| Realtek RTL8821CE | internal PCIe | `rtw88_8821ce` | high |
| AMD RZ616 | internal M.2 | `mt7921e` | low |

Known problematic: Intel AX200 (`iwlwifi`) and Atheros AR9271 (`ath9k_htc`) cannot be assigned an IP.

See [Adapters](docs/hardware_adapters.md) for the configuration each one needs.

## Setup

1. Create a Python venv and install `requirements.txt`.
2. Keep NetworkManager away from the LDN interfaces. Marking the Wi-Fi card unmanaged is not
   enough: a join creates a fresh `ldnclient` interface mid-run, NetworkManager grabs it and points
   wpa_supplicant at it, and the join fails with `[Errno 114] Match already configured`. Exclude the
   LDN interfaces by name:

   ```
   # /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/zz-ldn-unmanaged.conf
   [keyfile]
   unmanaged-devices=interface-name:ldnclient;interface-name:ldn;interface-name:ldn-mon;interface-name:ldn-tap
   ```

   then `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`. The file must sort last (`zz-*`): some distros ship
   a later-sorting file that sets `unmanaged-devices=none` and overrides it. Verify with
   `NetworkManager --print-config | grep unmanaged`.
3. Ensure you can become root. The entry points require it.

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| [`bin/`](bin) | what you run against a console. FireRed/LeafGreen: `frlg_mg_host.py` (Mystery Gift, Wonder News and native code), `frlg_mg_client.py` (receive a card from a console), `frlg_trade_host.py` (trade and Union Room host), `frlg_trade_join.py` (trade joiner). Let's Go: `lgpe_host.py`, `lgpe_join.py`. Sword/Shield: `swsh_connect.py` (trade), `swsh_gift_host.py` (Mystery Gift), `swsh_join.py` (scan). Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl: `bdsp_connect.py` (Union Room and trade), `bdsp_join.py`, `bdsp_pia_probe.py`. Legends Arceus: `pla_host.py` (trade), `pla_join.py` |
| [`tools/ldn/`](tools/ldn) | the radio, for any target: `ldn_scan.py`, `sniff.py`, `joyspot_probe.py`, `ldn_debug_report.sh` |
| [`tools/frlg/`](tools/frlg) | reading what a FireRed console sent back, offline: `dump_read.py`, `script_read.py`, `rom_functions.py`, `cartridge_pair.py`, `game_data_read.py`, `english_build.py` |
| [`tools/switch/`](tools/switch) | reading a retail Switch title's own code, offline: `xci_read.py`, `romfs_read.py`, `nso_read.py`, `nso_relocs.py`, `nso_imports.py`, `rtti_names.py`, `arm64_xref.py`, `arm64_dis.py` |
| [`pokeldn/`](pokeldn) | the package everything above is made of: `ldn/` the wireless layer, `gba/` the GBA link above it, `frlg/` `lgpe/` `swsh/` `bdsp/` `pla/` the games, `gen8.py` the Pokémon format Sword/Shield and Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl share |
| [`asm/`](asm) | ARM sources for the payloads the console runs; `scripts/gen_buffer_scripts.py` assembles them into `pokeldn/frlg/rom/buffer_payloads.py` |
| [`scripts/`](scripts) | setup, deployment and code generation; never pointed at a console |
| [`config/`](config) | host profiles (`host.toml`, and `host.local.toml` for this machine) |
| [`docs/`](docs) | the protocol findings, each with its citations; published at [decryptu.github.io/pokeldn](https://decryptu.github.io/pokeldn/) |
| [`tests/`](tests) | `python -m pytest tests/ -q` |
| [`vendor/`](vendor) | the bundled LDN implementation and the mt7601u AP-mode driver |

Run the entry points from the repo root: `sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python -u bin/frlg_mg_host.py ...`. They
put the root on `sys.path` themselves; config files and default output paths resolve against the
working directory.

## Usage

### FireRed and LeafGreen

#### Join a Switch-hosted trade

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/frlg_trade_join.py --live -o output.pk3 PARTY1.pk3 PARTY2.pk3
```

#### Host a Direct Corner trade

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/frlg_trade_host.py -o output.pk3 PARTY1.pk3 PARTY2.pk3
```

Linux advertises the group and acts as the trade leader. With the default settings it offers the
second supplied party member (`PARTY2.pk3`) and writes the Pokémon received from the Switch to
`output.pk3`. Host defaults come from `config/host.toml`, then the optional ignored
`config/host.local.toml`; command-line flags override both.
`bin/frlg_trade_host.py --print-effective-config` inspects the resolved profile without root or Wi-Fi
hardware.

Then:

1. Run the host command and wait for `Hosting Direct Corner`.
2. On the Switch, enter the Direct Corner and choose Join Group.
3. Select the Linux trainer and join. The leader performs its room-entry route automatically; wait
   until the host reports that trade selection is active.
4. On the Switch, select the Pokémon to trade away and accept the confirmation.
5. After the trade and save sequence returns to the trade menu, wait for the host prompt, then select
   **CANCEL** and confirm **YES**.
6. Allow the automated room exit and disconnect to finish. The received Pokémon is saved to
   `output.pk3` (or the path passed to `--out`).

Some optional flags:

| flag | options | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--verbose` | | per-packet protocol output; for `--replay` of a capture only, on a live link it stalls the console |
| `--phy` | phy name, e.g. `phy1` | Wi-Fi PHY selection |
| `--keys` | `/path/to/prod.keys` | non-default `prod.keys` location |
| `--slot` | zero-based party index | host party member offered in the trade |
| `--capture` | output path | JSONL diagnostic capture |
| `--config` | TOML path | replace the tracked shared host profile |
| `--local-config` / `--no-local-config` | TOML path / | select or disable the machine-local layer |
| `--print-effective-config` | | print the redacted resolved profile and exit |
| `--skip-encryption` | | delegate transmit CCMP to mac80211/hardware; traffic stays encrypted over the air |
| `--accept-decrypted-ccmp` | | accept driver-decrypted RX plaintext with retained CCMP metadata |
| `--ot` | Gen III trainer name | override the default trainer name for this run |
| `--version` | `firered` or `leafgreen` | override the configured game version |
| `--id` | decimal `TID[:SID]` | override the trainer ID, and optionally the secret ID |

`--help` is the authoritative list for each entry point.

#### Host a Union Room

`--union-room` advertises on the middle NPC's path instead of the Direct Corner's; the console applies
a different accept list.

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/frlg_trade_host.py --union-room --union-room-keepalive 120 \
  PARTY1.pk3 PARTY2.pk3
```

The console takes about ten seconds to appear to itself as connected; the wait is the RFU library's.
Add `--board-type normal` to register the offered Pokémon on the trading board,
`--union-room-chat` with `--chat-message` or `--chat-file` for chat, and
`--union-room-battle --battle-fight` for a link battle. In a battle the console elects itself master
and computes everything; the host answers its controller commands. The console needs two non-egg
Pokémon at level 30 or lower in its own party or it refuses on its own screen.

See [The link protocol](docs/frlg_link.md) for the connect sequence, the activity bytes and the link
buffer protocol.

#### Trainer identity

All three entry points start from `DEFAULT_TRAINER` in [`pokeldn/config.py`](pokeldn/config.py). Use
`--ot`, `--version` and `--id` for per-run overrides; the ID format is decimal `TID[:SID]`:

```bash
# Set TID to 12345 and retain DEFAULT_TRAINER.sid
./.venv/bin/python bin/frlg_trade_join.py --live --id=12345 PARTY1.pk3 PARTY2.pk3

# Set TID to 12345 and SID to 34567 while hosting
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/frlg_trade_host.py --live --id=12345:34567 PARTY1.pk3 PARTY2.pk3
```

Each component must be between 0 and 65535, and the resulting 32-bit LinkPlayer ID is
`(SID << 16) | TID`. The resolved profile is used consistently by discovery, Pia Session, RFU game
data, LinkPlayer and trainer-card identity. Edit `DEFAULT_TRAINER` for gender, language, National Dex
or game-completion defaults that have no CLI flag.

#### Distribute a Mystery Gift

`bin/frlg_mg_host.py` advertises on the Friend path and sends a Wonder Card plus a delivery RAM
script. The default payload is the repeatable legendary-beast cutscene.

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python -u bin/frlg_mg_host.py \
  --gift beast-cutscene --flag-id 1005 \
  --capture mystery-gift.jsonl
```

On the Switch choose **Mystery Gift → Wonder Cards → Friend**, then select the Linux host. The save
must already have Mystery Gift unlocked. `--make-artifact` writes a `.ram.lst` audit listing of the
exact card and delivery-script bytes a run sent.

The beast depends on the receiving save's starter: Bulbasaur gives Suicune, Squirtle gives Entei,
Charmander gives Raikou. The live host also distributes the two halves of a shared Stamp Rally card
(`--gift solrock-stamp` and `--gift lunatone-stamp`, in either order).

See [Mystery Gift](docs/frlg_gift.md) for the protocol flow, the gift catalogue, the authoring system,
and the Friend path requirement.

#### Distribute Wonder News

The console's Mystery Gift menu has a second column, and `--news` serves it. Wonder News is 444 bytes
of title and body with no flag ID, no delivery script and no gift attached: the reward is a berry from
the man in the house in Cerulean City. On the Switch choose **Mystery Gift → Wonder News → Friend**. A
Wonder Card host is not listed on that screen, and vice versa.

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python -u bin/frlg_mg_host.py --news
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python -u bin/frlg_mg_host.py --news berry --news-id 7
```

A console keeps news only when it differs from what it already holds; `--news-id N` makes the same
text land again.

#### Read the console's save

A Mystery Gift session can run native ARM code on the console and read its live save back, including
the secret ID and every party Pokémon's PID, IVs and nature.

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python -u bin/frlg_mg_host.py \
  --buffer-script save-dump --dump-block sav2 --dump-size 64 --dump-file dump.bin

./.venv/bin/python tools/frlg/dump_read.py dump.bin --block sav2
```

The console stays on its Mystery Gift menu, nothing is written and no Wonder Card changes hands. See
[Code on the console](docs/frlg_rom.md) for the mechanism and the other payloads.

#### Change a field of the console's save

The same session can edit the save instead of reading it. `flash-patch` reads the save sector a
field lives in off the flash chip, changes the bytes it means to, recomputes the game's checksum and
writes the sector back, then bumps one counter so the game loads the edited slot.

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python -u bin/frlg_mg_host.py \
  --buffer-script flash-patch --flash-id 0 --flash-patch-offset 0x00 \
  --flash-patch-hex cac9c5bfc6bec8ff --write-unsafe
```

Nothing is rebuilt from RAM, which is the point: a sector composed from the live save block loses the
encryption key and the saved map view, because the game writes both only as it saves. Every byte the
patch does not name is the byte the game itself put there. This edits a real save; see
[A RAM snapshot is not a save](docs/frlg_rom.md) before pointing it at one you care about.

### Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee

The console's trade screen alternates hosting and scanning, so pokeldn can host and let the console
join, or join the console's session. Both need a captured kind-1 identity message for `--first` /
`--reliable-payload` and a 232-byte PB7 box structure to offer (`pokeldn.lgpe.pb7` reads and writes
one; `--offer echo` hands the console its own back).

```bash
# host: the console finds PkCamp and joins
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/lgpe_host.py --seconds 600 --player-name PkCamp \
  --first identity.bin --our-trainer 41234:12345 --offer offer.pb7

# join the console's session, trade, and leave the way a console does
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/lgpe_join.py --connect --connect-seconds 300 \
  --reliable-payload identity.bin --ack-peer-clock --ack-re-announce \
  --our-trainer 41234:12345 --offer offer.pb7 --leave-after 15
```

On the console: menu → Communiquer → Communication locale → Échange, link code Pikachu, Pikachu,
Pikachu, then wait on the search screen. See [Let's Go](docs/lgpe.md).

### Sword and Shield

Trading joins the console's Link Trade session. The console hosts on Y-Comm → Link Trade over
local communication; its local communication id is filled at runtime, so the first run is a scan:

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/swsh_join.py --scan-only
```

Everything each advertisement carries is written to `scratchpad/swsh_net_facts.json`. The trade
itself is `bin/swsh_connect.py`, which walks the station handshake, the mesh join, the party
snapshot exchange and the confirmation ladder; `--offer-file FILE` puts a PKHeX `.pk8` on the wire
in place of a party slot. The flags a completed trade takes are on [Trading](docs/swsh_trade.md).

Mystery Gift needs no session: the gift screen scans, and a distributor advertises a network whose
advertise data carries the card.

```bash
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/swsh_gift_host.py --species 25 --level 25 \
  --move1 84 --move2 45 --move3 86 --move4 98 --nickname PKCAMP --ot POKELDN --seconds 300
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/swsh_gift_host.py --record card.wc8 --seconds 300
```

On the console: Mystery Gift → receive a gift → via local wireless. `--set FIELD=VALUE`
sets any record field by name (`shiny_type=3`, `ball=1`, `held_item=236`, `iv_hp=31`,
`gigantamax=1`), `--ribbon N` adds a ribbon, `--dump FILE` writes the record without a radio.
A kind-2 card's item ids are checked against the item table before serving: an id the game has no
row for is accepted and then aborts the game whenever its bag row is on screen. See
[Mystery Gift](docs/swsh_gift.md).

### Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl

pokeldn joins the console's Union Room as a character of its own. On the console: any Pokémon
Center → 2F → the left attendant → the plain "yes" (not the password or group option), then wait
in the Union Room, standing clear of the walls.

```bash
# see the session without joining it
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python tools/ldn/ldn_scan.py --channels 1,6,11,36,40,44,48 --dwell 0.8

# walk in, greet the player, and trade
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/bdsp_connect.py --channels 1,6,11 --count 9 --connect 5 --join 6 \
  --hold 420 --reliable-ack --reliable-sweep 3 --room-walk 15 --room-pattern fixed \
  --room-walk-steps 8 --join-avatar 0 --answer-requests --state 0 --recruiting 0 \
  --answer-talk --can-talk 0 --initiate-talk --initiate-delay 3 \
  --after-approach 0x06:0001000000 --trade-reply \
  --trade-template offer.pb8 --trade-nickname PKCAMP --src-var 0x2B7F4C12
```

A join is about a one-in-eight shot per attempt and `--room-pattern fixed` bursts fifteen. Use a
fresh `--src-var` on every run: the console keeps an id it has seen as one of its stations. When the character has appeared and finished walking, the player
opens Y → the communication menu → trade Pokémon, and the greeting comes up on its own. See
[Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl](docs/bdsp.md).

### Legends Arceus

The console's trade screen alternates scanning and hosting and registers its own protocols only
while it hosts, so pokeldn hosts and the console joins by link code.

```bash
# host, offering a record built from nothing
sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/pla_host.py --code 00000000 --channel 6 --seconds 1800 \
  --session-update --sustain --clock --data-exchange --data-exchange-name POKELDN \
  --data-exchange-id 11223344 --game-channel --trade-box --trade-box-record offer.pa8 \
  --trade-box-collect records/

# the same host against an emulated console over the LAN, no radio and no root
./.venv/bin/python bin/pla_host.py --ip-host --our-ip 172.16.86.128 --code 00000000 ...
```

On the console: Simona at Jubilife Village → trade → someone nearby → the same eight-digit code,
then offer a Pokémon up and confirm. The host answers every showing and every offer, re-reads its
record file between offers so the offer can be changed without rejoining, and writes each distinct
record the console shows to `--trade-box-collect`.

`pokeldn.pla.pokemon` reads and writes the record, `build` composes one from 376 zero bytes, and
`pokeldn.pla.stats` gives the stats and the size the game itself would compute. See
[Legends Arceus](docs/pla.md).

### Diagnostics

- `tools/ldn/ldn_scan.py` prints discoverable LDN networks and decoded FRLG application data.
- `tools/ldn/sniff.py` captures advertisement and management traffic from a monitor-capable radio.
- `tools/ldn/ldn_debug_report.sh` records local radio, interface, route and NetworkManager state.
- `--capture FILE` on either host writes the protocol trace as JSONL.

See [Host implementation](docs/frlg_host.md) for the component boundaries, protocol flow, timing
ownership and shutdown sequence.
