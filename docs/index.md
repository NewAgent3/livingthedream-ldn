# pokeldn

pokeldn is a Linux implementation of Nintendo Switch local wireless (LDN) that speaks to Pokemon
games running on retail Switch hardware. These pages document the protocols involved, with the
decompilation citations, disassembly addresses and hardware measurements behind each finding.

Installation, the command-line reference and the code layout are in the
[repository README](https://github.com/Decryptu/pokeldn#readme).

## Targets

Four games, all on retail hardware, all over the same LDN and Pia layers, plus a fifth in
bring-up:

| | FRLG | LGPE | SwSh | BDSP | PLA | Tomodachi |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Trade | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | △ |
| Mystery Gift | ✓ | ∅ | ✓ | ∅ | ∅ | ∅ |
| Link battle | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ∅ | ∅ |
| Code on the console, save read and write | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

✓ works on a retail console · ✗ not done · ∅ the game has no such feature over local wireless ·
△ bring-up: the link is wired and the storage format is done, but no session has been captured
FRLG FireRed/LeafGreen · LGPE Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee · SwSh Sword/Shield · BDSP Brilliant
Diamond/Shining Pearl · PLA Legends Arceus · Tomodachi Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream

FireRed and LeafGreen run as the original GBA ROM inside an emulator on the Switch, so the ROM's
own GBA link protocol is stacked on the console's LDN and Pia. The three other games put their
own code directly on Pia: Unity/IL2CPP in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, C++ with protocol
buffers over `gflnet3` in Sword and Shield and in Let's Go.
